# trinity_script
Short for loop code for movement of files based on an input list

-s = --source_dir; will be the full path to the directory where the full pool of proteome files lives
-l = --list_file; will be a text file containing the name of each file to copy, with each file on a new line
-d = --dest_dir; will be a full path to the directory where you would like these to land; the scipt will create this folder if needed
